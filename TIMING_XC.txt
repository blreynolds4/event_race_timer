Pre Race Data:
config json for each race
source map config for rest server
    rest server needs race name and source map (writes to race event stream) (connects readers to event stream)
    placer needs source ranks, race name, athletes (reads race event stream) (generates default places by time for know athlete bibs only)
    manual cli needs race name (Should use "manual" source name) (writes/reads race event stream)
    result builder needs race name, source ranks, and athletes (reads race events, writes to result stream)
    scorer needs race name (reads result stream)

Source ranking
    finish-mat is number 1 for finish time
    manual is number 2 for everything
    default-placer is number 3, places that are manually sent/swapped should override placer
    chute is 3 for finish time as a back up


start the webserver
start default placer
start result builder

start a manual cli
    send start event and start backup timer and manual timer

Start the Reader Race manager
RaceManager set the race clock in sync with start event
Start Collecting when first runner is coming

Start overall scorer
Start xc team scorer


Notes:  default placer will resend all the place events with each finish, so it could override
a swap event in the result builder.  Write swap handler to handle that?
